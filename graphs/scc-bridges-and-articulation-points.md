## In and Out time of nodes

1. Given 2 nodes, find whether one node lies in the subtree of another node. 
2. In the context of DFS, in-time refers to the moment when a vertex is first visited (explored), and out-time refers to the moment when the DFS has finished exploring all the neighbors of a vertex (i.e., when the algorithm finishes processing the vertex and backtracks).
